# Flowchart-creator-for-GenPipes
Implement a test flowchart in python for the 5 first steps of the DNAseq pipeline.
A flow-chart creator that automatically builds the flowchart from the steps chosen by the user. This happens when we add the decorator @TraceCalls() before every step in the pipeline. As the development of these pipelines is in constant evolution, the change can be easily incorporated in the flowchart creator by adding or removing the decorator.
